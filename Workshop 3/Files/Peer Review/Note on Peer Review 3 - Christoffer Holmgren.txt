Christoffer Holmgrens peer review is based on an old version of my project.



Secondly regarding stealing from wikipedia.
The code comments clearly state it's source.

The code is found through:
https://coursepress.lnu.se/kurs/objektorienterad-analys-och-design-med-uml/en/workshops/workshop-3-design-using-patterns/
On this page the sublink to: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern is found.
The reference to this code with the use of comments, was used in all version of the project.

It is only logical an example from Wikipedia was used as it came from the same page that teacher provided me.
However, the implementation was done by myself and adjusted where needed to. So the question remains if there is a copyright issue that code? If not, I don't think there is an issue?



He did also mention that Stand did not work. This is only partly correct.
In older version the command for Stand was given by accident to 'a' instead of 's'.
He described a lot of other input command bugs, which I however could not find.
