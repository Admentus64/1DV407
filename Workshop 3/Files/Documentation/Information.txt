--- Main Information ---
------------------------

Please note that in order to run the program a development environment is required that can compile / read / edit / etc .java files.
Alternative, a .jar file can be used to directly run the program without the need for a development environment.
Please read the document Instructions.txt for more information about running the program by using the .jar file.



-----------------------------
--- Importing Source Code ---
-----------------------------

a) Using NetBeans IDE 8.0.1

1) Start NetBeans.
2) Go to: File -> New Project
3) New window opens, in step 1. Choose Project, choose: Java -> Java Application, press next.
4) Give your project a Project Name and a location on your pc where to store is, Create Main Clas is not required.
5) Once the source folder is created on your pc, go to that folder.
6) Copy my "src" folder into the main folder of your project. Netbeans should detect these files and add them in your new project.
7) Run the project, choose a main class is required (only 1 main class is available to choose from).
8) It should work now.

PS: Most version of NetBeans work, for best results choose version 8.0.1 or newer.

b) Using Eclipse

Eclipse works the same way as NetBeans, but some names for the steps described above could be a bit different. Eclipse should also detect new files placed within your projects "src" folder.



-----------------------------------
--- In order to run the program ---
-----------------------------------

The development environment NetBeans 8.0.1 was used for this exercise, but Eclipse would work also.
A Java Development Kit is required to run this program (JDK). JDK8 (version 1.8.0_20) was used for this exercise.
A Java Runtime Environment would mostly like be required too (JRE). JRE8 (version 1.8.0_20) was used for this exercise.
Please read the file Instructions.txt for more information about installing the JDK and JRE.
